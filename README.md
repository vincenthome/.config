# .config

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/vincenthome/.config.git
```

p.s. In WSL, if we are seeing broken characters in terminal, as soon as installed Oh My Zsh. To remedy this we need to install the Powerline fonts and tell our terminal to use them.

```
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git
```

Then open an admin PowerShell, navigate to the root of the repo and run:

```
.\install.ps1
```

If PowerShell blocks you from running the script, then try setting the ExecutionPolicy as per this [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4037939/powershell-says-execution-of-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system/4038991#4038991](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4037939/powershell-says-execution-of-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system/4038991#4038991)

Finally, right click on the terminalâ€™s title bar, choose Properties > Font and make sure a Powerline font is selected. In testing, Deja Vu Sans Mono for Powerline.
